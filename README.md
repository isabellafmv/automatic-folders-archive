Automatically create new monthly and yearly folders for daily notes in Obsidian and archive past daily notes in the right place.

-> your daily notes will have to be placed in a "basefolder" for the plugin to work. i.e. you need to specify a new file location in the daily notes settings, and then input that specific folder into the plugin settings.
